# AI-Based Scholarship Recommendation System

This project is an AI-based platform that recommends scholarships based on various criteria using machine learning. The system consists of a frontend for user interaction, a backend for API and database management, and a machine learning model for generating recommendations.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend:
- **React.js**: Used to build the interactive user interface.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For responsive and modern design.

### Backend:
- **Node.js**: Server-side JavaScript runtime.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for building RESTful APIs.
- **MySQL**: Relational database for storing user data and scholarship information.

### Machine Learning Model:
- **FastAPI**: Python-based web framework for serving the ML model.
- **Decision Tree Classifier**: A machine learning algorithm for recommendation.
- **Scikit-learn**: Library used to implement the Decision Tree model.
- **Model Accuracy**: The model achieves **88% accuracy** in predicting scholarship eligibility.

## Project Setup
